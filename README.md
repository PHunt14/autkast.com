# Plans
Have a nav-bar that travels with the browser window? (phase 1)

Have the "coolest", most eye-catching, biggest, you know, the hook, at the top of the page.  This will be an unbiased section (any article from any source can go in), but can definitely link to a biased story. (phase 1)

Have a split-screen page layout at this point, below the headliner. (phase 1)

Left-Side: F-News (phase 1)

Right-Side: A-News (phase 1)

Have a Mainstream Media link as well that logs posts directly from CNN, NBC, Fox, BBC, Huffington Post, Times, etc. (phase 2)
